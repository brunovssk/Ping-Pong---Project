# Ping-Pong---Project

A ping pong game was developed using JavaScript and p5.js with a table, two rackets, and a ball. Players score points by passing the ball through the opponent's racket, controlled by W and S keys. The project was completed successfully thanks to the course despite the challenge it posed.
